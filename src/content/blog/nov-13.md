### Action points
- Decide what we want to get specifically out of the HTML group
- Find someone who can chair the API group

### Discussion

At the start of the meeting we discussed what we'd be looking for out of the HTML group and what we'd want to see it create.

We discussed needing someone to chair the api group that has time but also is comfortable with setups like swagger.

The group spoke about how a physical meetup could help speed along development of a solution. Both Glasgow and Copenhagen were suggested.

There was a suggestion to break the group into a smaller technical group that would have time to work on a solution that could then be presented to the wider group for a faster iteration of feedback.
