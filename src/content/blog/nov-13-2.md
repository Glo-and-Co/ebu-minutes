### Action points
- Start building a small component people can start playing with to get feedback

### Discussion

A small secondary meeting between Ben and Johan to discuss trying to create something usable for the group to start iterations on.

We agreed that the solution should be as agnostic as possible allowing a solution to be used or recreated within a framework.

We spoke about Web Components being a good starting place based on them being building blocks for other web frameworks and a predefined web standard.
